Once you unzip the contents of this folder, launching the 'project' file should work (assuming Ableton is preinstalled on your PC). 
In case you launch the project file, but Ableton says 'missing files', click and drag the 'poly_synth' file into Ableton and it should work.
Alternatively, if that does not work, copy and paste the 'poly_synth' and 'single_voice' files into your User Library folder. By default it is this directory: Documents -> Ableton -> User Library. 
If youve done the above steps and you see no errors, but all the tracks have all their knobs turned down to zero, re-launch the project and it should fix itself.
Have fun!
